            <h2>San Francisco, CA - Tech for good at Twilio <small>May 17</small></h2>
            <p>Techqueria & Latinx@Twilio invites you to join the
            conversation of bridging the gap in tech and social action. Have
            you wondered what the Latinxs in tech can do to help our
            communities with local policies? Learn what Techqueria is working
            on in their #action channel and how you can get involved.
            Afterwards, there will be a panel discussion discussing how we
            can increase voter action in our communities through the power of
            cloud communications and partnerships with advocacy groups.</p>
